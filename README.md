# pitchPerfect

First iOS App w/ Swift

## Created an iOS App purely in Swift through Udacity. 

It is a simple mobile application that consists of two views. The first view presents the user with the ability to record the voice. The second view provides the user the ability to alter their recorded voice using 6 different audio modifications (slow, fast, high pitch, low pitch, echo, and reverb). 


| Recording View | Modification View |
| ------------------|:--------------------:|

The microphone is activated as soon as the users taps the screen to record. The stop button will become highlighted as soon as the audio recording begins. 


As soon as the user taps the stop button, the user will be presented with a second view which will consist of the 6 different
audio modifications.
