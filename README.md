First iOS App w/ Swift

## Created an iOS App purely in Swift through Udacity. 

It is a simple mobile application that consists of two views. The first view presents the user with the ability to record the voice. The second view provides the user the ability to alter their recorded voice using 6 different audio modifications (slow, fast, high pitch, low pitch, echo, and reverb).
